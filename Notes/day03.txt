INSERT INTO persons (ID, AGE, first_name, last_name) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
ORM(Object Relational Mapping)

Cons of JDBC
	DB structure is complex, JDBC is nightmare
	Tedious to maintain
	changes to DB make lot of changes to query syntax
ORM
	create a class corresponding to the table
	map the class with the table
	map the variables with columns

	Hibernate framework(RedHat)
	TopLink(Oracle)
	iBatis(not exactly ORM)
