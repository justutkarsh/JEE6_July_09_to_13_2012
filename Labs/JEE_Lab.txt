--Step 1--

--> Create a web application "JEE6" in JBoss 6.xxx
--> Create a JSP page with the following textboxes

Employee Id, Employee Name, Date of Joining
On clicking the "Add" button you will add the details to the database("employees table" in "employeesdb").
Redirect to a page that lists all the employees in a tabular format.

--> You will use JPA to talk to the Database
--> JPA will use a datasource "java:/BankDS"
